# materializecss-kotlin-types
Materializecss (https://materializecss.com/) types from DefinitelyTyped (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) converted using Dukat (https://github.com/Kotlin/dukat) and manually fixed to be working with Kotlin JS!

Requires kotlin-js-jquery to work: https://www.kotlinresources.com/library/kotlin-js-jquery/
